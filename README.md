# LED_Brightness-

In this task, we controlled the brightness of the LED using a potentiometer.

Connect the Arduino circuit :

Potentiometer:

1- Middle pin to pin A0 in Arduino board.

2- Left pin to 5V in Arduino board.

3- Right pin to GND in Arduino board.

LED:

1- The shorter leg of the LED with the resistor.

2- The other side of the resistor with the GND in the Arduino board.

3- The longer leg of the LED with Digital pin 6 in the Arduino board.

Connect the Arduino board to the computer with the USB and upload the code.

Output:
